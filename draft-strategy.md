# Draft Strategy

1. Draft your offensive starting lineup first before drafting bench players
   - Spend less on Kickers and Defenses because they are less predictable and score fewer points
2. Spend most (or even all) of your cap on starters
   - A Harvard analysis showed that most people over-spend on bench players and under-spend on key starters
   - Bench players only benefit your team if a starter gets injured or they outperform a starter
   - In a standard league, 1500 points would likely put you in the top 10% of teams
   - Your goal is to maximize your starting lineupâ€™s projected points
3. For starters, pick the players with the highest sum of projected points (especially floor), while minimizing risk (i.e., a low risk and a high floor)
4. For bench players, pick the players with a high ceiling
   - That way, one or more of your bench players has a chance to outperform your starters or be a solid replacement if your starters get injured
   - You should be willing to accept a higher risk for bench players than for starters
5. Give players more weight if they have a high dropoff (the player is projected to score many more points than the next best players at the same position)
